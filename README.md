# Task-tracker-app with React

In this repository I will be building a task tracker app and look at components, props, state, hooks, working with an API and more.

## Introduction
React is a library for building user interfaces. It runs on the client as `Single Page App(SPA)` but can be used to build full stack apps by communicating to the server/API (eg. ``MERN``)

React is often referreed to as a front-end framework because it is capable and directly comparable to framework such as `Angular` or `Vue`.

## Why React?
1. Structure the 'view' (`user interface`) layer of your application.
2. Reusable components with their own state.
3. `JSX` - Dynamic markup.
4. Interactive UIs with `virtual DOM` - makes the app faster.
5. Performance and testing.
6. Very Popular in the industry.
7. Managing data is easier 

## Working with state
Components can have "state" which is an object that determines how a component renders or behaves

'`App`' or '`global`' state refers to a state that is available to the entire UI, not just a single component

## React hooks
React hooks are functions that let's us hook into the React state and lifecyle features from function components.

1. useState - Returns a stateful value and a function to update it.

2. useEffect - Performs side effects in function components

3. useContext, useReducer, useRef ...
